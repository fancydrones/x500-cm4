## Performance Results (macOS)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Camera Input** | 30 FPS |
| **Processing Rate** | 6-7 FPS (adaptive) |
| **Frames Dropped** | ~23-24 per second |
| **Inference Time** | 130-180ms per frame |
| **Format Conversion** | 100-150ms (NV12→RGB) |
| **Total Processing** | ~270ms per frame |
| **Preview Latency** | < 100ms |
| **Memory Usage** | Stable, no leaks |

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Solved Preview Latency Problem
**Problem**: Preview showed old frames with 3+ second lag when moving camera.

**Root Cause**: Frames were buffering in the pipeline faster than they could be processed (30 FPS input vs 3.7 FPS processing).

**Solution**: Two-level frame dropping
- `toilet_capacity: 1` - drops old frames before reaching processor
- Time-based skipping - ensures minimum 270ms between processing
- Result: Preview shows current frames with < 100ms latency

### 2. Adaptive Performance Without Manual Flow Control
**Problem**: Manual flow control had compatibility issues with Camera component (toilet overflow errors).

**Solution**: Hybrid approach
- Auto flow control (simpler, more compatible)
- Time-based adaptive frame skipping
- Natural adaptation to CPU load
- Result: Same adaptive behavior without complexity

### 3. Annotation Coordinate Handling
**Problem**: Bounding boxes were misaligned with detected objects.

**Solution**: Proper coordinate management
- Run detection on 640x640 downscaled image
- Draw annotations on 640x640 using original coordinates
- Scale coordinates for metadata only
- Result: Accurate bounding box placement

### 4. Web Preview Frame Updates
**Problem**: Same frame sent repeatedly causing perceived lag.

**Solution**: Frame-ID tracking
- Increment counter on each frame update
- Server polls until new frame detected
- Send immediately when available
- Result: Real-time preview with minimal latency

## Architecture

## Critical Learnings for Phase 1 (Raspberry Pi)

### 1. Use Auto Flow Control (Not Manual)
✅ **DO**: Use auto flow control with time-based skipping
❌ **DON'T**: Use manual flow control (compatibility issues)

### 2. Two-Level Frame Dropping is Essential
✅ **DO**: Implement both toilet buffer AND time-based skipping
❌ **DON'T**: Rely on toilet alone (still processes buffered frames)

### 3. Update last_process_time After Processing
✅ **DO**: Update timestamp after frame is fully processed
❌ **DON'T**: Update before processing (breaks time-based logic)

### 4. Calculate FPS Before Preview Update
✅ **DO**: Calculate statistics then send to preview
❌ **DON'T**: Send stats with placeholder values (FPS shows 0)

### 5. Scale Preview Image Appropriately
✅ **DO**: Use 50% width or smaller to prevent overflow
❌ **DON'T**: Use 100% width (causes vertical scroll on smaller screens)

## Testing Instructions

### Start Web Preview
```bash
cd /Users/royveshovda/src/fancydrones/x500-cm4/apps/video_annotator
mix run test_web_preview.exs
```

### Access Preview
Open browser to: **http://localhost:4001**

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Live video stream with bounding boxes
- ✅ FPS counter updating every second (~6-7 FPS)
- ✅ Frame count incrementing
- ✅ Detection count showing objects in current frame
- ✅ Minimal lag when moving camera
- ✅ No vertical overflow on page

## Next Steps for Phase 1

### 1. Port to Raspberry Pi
- Adjust `target_interval_ms` from 270ms to 500-600ms
- Test with Raspberry Pi camera
- Verify performance (expected 2-4 FPS)

### 2. Consider Optimizations
- Lower camera resolution (640x480 or 1280x720)
- Smaller YOLO input (416x416 or 320x320)
- Hardware acceleration (GPU if available)
- Quantized model (INT8 instead of FP32)

### 3. Integration with MAVLink
- Send detection results to flight controller
- Implement target tracking logic
- Add gimbal control based on detections

### 4. Production Hardening
- Add error recovery and restart logic
- Implement health monitoring
- Add logging and telemetry
- Create deployment scripts
