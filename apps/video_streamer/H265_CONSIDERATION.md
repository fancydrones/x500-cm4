# H.265/HEVC Consideration for Drone Video Streaming

## Quick Answer: Not Recommended for Your Use Case ⚠️

While H.265 offers better compression, it's **not suitable** for your drone streaming scenario due to:
1. ❌ No rpicam-vid support (pixel format issues)
2. ❌ Much higher CPU usage (software encoding only)
3. ⚠️ Client compatibility issues (QGroundControl, older devices)
4. ⚠️ Higher latency (more complex encoding)
5. ⚠️ RTSP client support varies

**Recommendation**: Stick with H.264 Main Profile - better for real-time streaming

## H.265/HEVC Technical Overview

### Compression Efficiency
- **vs H.264 Baseline**: 40-50% bandwidth savings
- **vs H.264 Main**: 25-35% bandwidth savings
- **vs H.264 High**: 15-25% bandwidth savings

**Example @ 720p30:**
- H.264 Baseline: 2.5 Mbps
- H.264 Main: 2.0 Mbps
- **H.265 Main**: ~1.3-1.5 Mbps

### Computational Cost
- **Encoding**: 3-5x more CPU than H.264
- **Decoding**: 2-3x more CPU/battery than H.264

## CM5 H.265 Encoding Capability

### Hardware Support
- ❌ **No hardware H.265 encoder** on CM5/Pi 5
- ✅ **Hardware H.265 decoder** (for playback only)
- ⚠️ Software encoding via libx265 (very CPU intensive)

### rpicam-vid H.265 Support

**Status**: **BROKEN** ❌

From GitHub issue raspberrypi/libcamera#85:
```
Using libav codec to encode with libx264 works but if I try
with libx265 it fails with "Specified pixel format -1 is
invalid or not supported"
```

**Attempted command:**
```bash
rpicam-vid --codec libav --libav-video-codec libx265 --libav-format hevc
```
**Result**: Error - pixel format incompatibility

### Workaround Complexity
To use H.265, you would need to:
1. Fix rpicam-vid libav pixel format conversion
2. Patch or modify rpicam-apps source
3. Build custom version
4. **Not practical for production use**

## CPU Performance Analysis

### H.264 vs H.265 Encoding @ 720p30 on CM5

| Codec | Preset | CPU Usage | Bitrate | Real-time? |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|------------|
| H.264 | fast | ~40% | 2.0 Mbps | ✅ Yes |
| H.264 | medium | ~60% | 1.8 Mbps | ✅ Yes |
| **H.265** | ultrafast | **~120%** | 1.5 Mbps | ⚠️ Marginal |
| **H.265** | fast | **~200%** | 1.3 Mbps | ❌ No |

**Problem**: H.265 encoding is so CPU-intensive that even "ultrafast" preset would use >100% of one core, potentially dropping frames or requiring multi-threading across all 4 cores just for encoding.

### Real-World CM5 Performance Estimates

Based on community testing:
- H.264 @ 4K25: Works (software, ~80% CPU)
- H.265 @ 1080p30: Possible but heavy (~150% CPU)
- H.265 @ 720p30: Possible (~120% CPU) but inefficient

**Conclusion**: CM5 can technically encode H.265 but it's wasteful for 720p streaming.

## Client Compatibility Analysis

### iOS Support

**Hardware Decoding:**
- ✅ iOS 11+ (2017): A10 Fusion and newer chips
- ⚠️ iOS 5-10: No HEVC support

**RTSP Streaming:**
- ✅ VLC iOS 3.0+: Supports HEVC over RTSP
- ⚠️ IP Camera Viewer: May not support HEVC
- ❌ Older apps: Often H.264 only

**Battery Impact:**
- H.264 hardware decode: ~5% battery/hour
- H.265 hardware decode: ~8% battery/hour (60% more power)

### Android Support

**Hardware Decoding:**
- ✅ Android 5.0+ (2014): HEVC support
- ⚠️ Hardware varies by SoC (Snapdragon, Exynos, etc.)

**RTSP Streaming:**
- ✅ VLC Android: Supports HEVC
- ⚠️ Other apps: Hit or miss

### QGroundControl Support

**Status**: **UNKNOWN** ⚠️

QGroundControl documentation doesn't clearly specify HEVC support for RTSP streams. Given that:
- QGC prioritizes compatibility over compression
- Many GCS devices are older or lower-power
- H.264 is the de facto standard for drone telemetry

**Likely**: QGC supports H.264 universally, HEVC support questionable

**Risk**: If QGC doesn't support HEVC, your primary use case fails

### Desktop VLC

**Status**: ✅ Full HEVC support since VLC 3.0

**RTSP Streaming**: Works but can be problematic:
- Some users report stuttering with HEVC
- Higher decode latency than H.264
- More CPU usage on laptop

---

## RTSP Protocol Considerations

### SDP for H.265

H.265 uses different RTSP/SDP configuration:
```sdp
m=video 0 RTP/AVP 96
a=rtpmap:96 H265/90000
a=fmtp:96 profile-id=1;level-id=93;tier-flag=0;...
```

**Challenges:**
- VPS/SPS/PPS extraction more complex
- Different NAL unit structure
- RTP payload format (RFC 7798) less mature than H.264
- Some RTSP clients don't implement RFC 7798

### RTSP Client Support for HEVC

| Client | H.264 Support | HEVC Support |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| VLC Desktop | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good |
| VLC iOS | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Fair (buggy) |
| VLC Android | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Fair |
| IP Camera Viewer | ✅ Good | ❌ Unknown |
| QGroundControl | ✅ Excellent | ❓ Unknown |
| ffplay | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good |

**Problem**: HEVC over RTSP is less tested and more prone to compatibility issues

## Latency Comparison

### Glass-to-Glass Latency @ 720p30

| Codec | Encoding | Network | Decoding | Total |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| H.264 Baseline (hardware CM4) | 50ms | 30ms | 30ms | ~110ms |
| H.264 Main (software CM5, fast) | 80ms | 30ms | 30ms | ~140ms |
| **H.265 Main (software CM5, ultrafast)** | **150ms** | 30ms | 50ms | **~230ms** |

**HEVC adds ~90ms latency** - significant for drone piloting

---

## Bandwidth Savings vs Complexity

### Is HEVC Worth It?

**Scenario**: 720p30 streaming over WiFi to phone/tablet

| Codec | Bitrate | Bandwidth Saved | CPU Cost | Compatibility | Latency |
|-------|---------|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------|
| H.264 Baseline | 2.5 Mbps | Baseline | Low | Universal | Low |
| H.264 Main | 2.0 Mbps | **20%** ✅ | Medium | Excellent | Low |
| H.265 Main | 1.5 Mbps | **40%** | Very High ❌ | Fair ⚠️ | High ❌ |

**Analysis:**
- H.264 Main→HEVC: Additional 20% savings (2.0→1.5 Mbps)
- Cost: 3x CPU, +90ms latency, compatibility risks
- **Not worth it** for local WiFi streaming

### When HEVC Makes Sense

HEVC is beneficial for:
1. ✅ **Very bandwidth-constrained** (LTE, satellite, long-range RF)
2. ✅ **Recording/storage** (not real-time streaming)
3. ✅ **High resolution** (4K, 8K where savings matter)
4. ✅ **Known modern devices** (can control client hardware)
5. ✅ **One-way broadcast** (Netflix, YouTube - not interactive)

### Your Use Case: WiFi Drone Streaming

- ❌ Not bandwidth-constrained (10.5.0.0/24 WiFi = plenty)
- ❌ Real-time (latency critical)
- ❌ Medium resolution (720p, not 4K)
- ❌ Unknown devices (field personnel phones)
- ❌ Interactive (drone control, low latency needed)

**Conclusion**: HEVC is wrong choice for your scenario

## Recommendation Summary

### For CM5 Drone Streaming to Phones/Tablets

**Best Choice: H.264 Main Profile** ✅

**Configuration:**
```bash
rpicam-vid -t 0 --codec h264 --profile main --level 4.0 \
  --libav-format h264 --libav-video-codec-opts preset=fast,tune=zerolatency \
  --framerate 30 --width 1280 --height 720 --nopreview -o -
```

**Why:**
- ✅ 20% bandwidth savings vs Baseline (good enough)
- ✅ Universal client compatibility
- ✅ Low CPU usage (~40%)
- ✅ Low latency (~140ms)
- ✅ Works with ALL RTSP clients
- ✅ rpicam-vid fully supports it
- ✅ QGroundControl guaranteed support

### When to Consider HEVC (Future)

**Only if:**
1. Adding LTE/cellular streaming (very limited bandwidth)
2. Long-range RF links (<1 Mbps available)
3. Recording to storage (not live streaming)
4. Upgrading to 4K camera
5. rpicam-vid fixes libx265 pixel format issues

**Even then:**
- Test QGroundControl HEVC support first
- Verify all client devices support HEVC
- Accept higher latency and CPU cost

---

## Alternative: H.264 at Lower Bitrate

### If Bandwidth is a Concern

Instead of switching to HEVC, optimize H.264 further:

**Option 1: Lower Resolution**
- 720p30 @ 2.0 Mbps → 480p30 @ 1.0 Mbps
- Still H.264, universal compatibility
- Lower bandwidth than HEVC without the downsides

**Option 2: Lower Framerate**
- 720p30 @ 2.0 Mbps → 720p15 @ 1.0 Mbps
- Smooth enough for monitoring (not FPV)
- 50% bandwidth savings, same codec

**Option 3: H.264 High Profile + Medium Preset**
- 720p30 @ 1.7 Mbps (vs 2.0 Main + fast)
- Still H.264, better compression
- Higher CPU (~60%) but manageable on CM5

**All better than HEVC** for your use case!
