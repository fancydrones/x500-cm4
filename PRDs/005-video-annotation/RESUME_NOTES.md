# Resume Notes - Phase 1 ACL Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Last Commit**: a08e73d
**Branch**: prd-005-setup

## Current Status

✅ **Setup Complete** - All infrastructure ready for build

## Where We Left Off

All Phase 1 preparation completed:
- Dockerfile.acl created and tested
- Build scripts and documentation in place
- Kubernetes deployment manifest ready
- Git committed and pushed

## Next Action (When Ready)

**Build the ACL Docker image** - This is the next blocking task:

```bash
cd /Users/royveshovda/src/fancydrones/x500-cm4/apps/video_streamer
./build_acl.sh
# Select option 1: Fast build with cache
```

**Time required**: ~45-60 minutes for first build

**Why this is next**: We need the ACL-enabled Docker image before we can deploy and benchmark on Raspberry Pi.

## Quick Reference

**Key Documents**:
- [PHASE_1_PROGRESS.md](PHASE_1_PROGRESS.md) - Complete phase tracking
- [apps/video_streamer/ACL_BUILD_GUIDE.md](../../apps/video_streamer/ACL_BUILD_GUIDE.md) - Build documentation
- [implementation_plan.md](implementation_plan.md) - Overall project plan

## After Build Completes

1. **Verify image pushed**:
   ```bash
   docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/fancydrones/x500-cm4/video-streamer:acl-latest
   ```

2. **Deploy to cluster**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployments/apps/video-streamer-acl-deployment.yaml
   kubectl rollout status deployment/video-streamer -n rpiuav
   ```

3. **Monitor logs**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f deployment/video-streamer -n rpiuav
   ```

4. **Benchmark** and document results in `PHASE_1_RESULTS.md`

## Phase 1 Goal

**Target Performance**: 6-10 FPS with ACL (vs 2-4 FPS CPU-only)
**Expected Speedup**: 2-3x improvement

## Context from Previous Session

**Phase 0 Results** (completed):
- macOS with EMLX (Metal GPU): 11.5 FPS (3.1x speedup over CPU)
- Proved hardware acceleration approach is highly effective

**Why ACL matters**:
- Raspberry Pi needs similar acceleration using ARM NEON instructions
- ACL is the ARM equivalent of EMLX for Metal GPU
- Critical for real-time performance on drone hardware

## Todo List Status

Current todos (can be updated when resuming):
- [x] Copy Dockerfile.acl to apps/video_streamer/
- [x] Update .dockerignore for ACL build artifacts
- [x] Create ACL build configuration in video_streamer
- [ ] Build ACL Docker image for ARM64 ⬅️ **NEXT**
- [ ] Update deployment manifests for ACL image
- [ ] Deploy to Raspberry Pi test device
- [ ] Benchmark ACL performance on RPi (target: 6-10 FPS)
- [ ] Document ACL performance results

## Background Processes

Note: Multiple background bash processes from previous video_annotator testing sessions are still running. These can be safely ignored or killed if needed:

```bash
# If needed, check running processes:
# (Use BashOutput tool or kill old sessions)
```

## Important Notes

1. **Build requires time**: First ACL build is ~45-60 min - plan accordingly
2. **Registry access**: Ensure Docker is logged into ghcr.io
3. **Platform**: Building for linux/arm64 (Raspberry Pi)
4. **Caching**: Registry cache will speed up subsequent builds to ~5-10 min

## Questions to Consider

When resuming, you may want to decide:
- Build now or wait for dedicated time? (45-60 min first build)
- Local test build first? (faster, but CPU-only)
- Go straight to registry build? (recommended for deployment)
