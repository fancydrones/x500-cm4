## Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage

| Component | Tests | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| RTSP Protocol | 22 tests | ~85% | ✅ Good |
| SDP Generation | 20 tests | ~90% | ✅ Good |
| Overall | 42 tests | ~40% | ⚠️ Acceptable* |

*Note: Low overall coverage due to hardware-dependent components (camera, pipeline). Core protocol modules have good coverage. Hardware validation prioritized over unit test coverage.

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Latency (glass-to-glass) | <500ms | 300-500ms | ✅ Met |
| CPU Usage | <50% | 30-50% | ✅ Met |
| Memory Usage | <200MB | ~120MB | ✅ Exceeded |
| Network Bandwidth | Variable | 4-8 Mbps | ✅ Acceptable |
| Simultaneous Clients | 3+ | 3+ confirmed | ✅ Met |
| Container Size | <150MB | 257MB | ⚠️ Deferred to backlog |

### Code Quality

- ✅ All code formatted with `mix format`
- ✅ No compilation warnings
- ✅ All tests passing (42/42)
- ✅ ExDoc documentation generated
- ✅ Typespecs for public functions
- ✅ Comprehensive module documentation

## Deferred Items & Future Enhancements

### Low Priority (Deferred to Backlog)

1. **Docker Image Optimization** (257MB → <150MB target)
   - Rationale: Current size acceptable for deployment
   - Effort: Medium
   - Priority: Low

2. **24-Hour Stability Test**
   - Rationale: System running stable in production
   - Effort: Low (documentation only)
   - Priority: Low

3. **Demo Video Recording**
   - Rationale: System operational, video demonstration not critical
   - Effort: Low
   - Priority: Low

4. **Additional Unit Test Coverage** (40% → 80%)
   - Rationale: Core modules well-tested, hardware validation completed
   - Effort: High
   - Priority: Medium

5. **Troubleshooting Flowcharts**
   - Rationale: Text guide sufficient for current needs
   - Effort: Low
   - Priority: Low

### Future Enhancements

1. **RTSP over TLS/HTTPS** - Enhanced security
2. **Recording Functionality** - Save streams to disk
3. **Stream Analytics Dashboard** - Real-time metrics visualization
4. **Multi-Resolution Streaming** - Adaptive quality
5. **TCP/Interleaved Transport** - Better NAT traversal for iOS clients
6. **WebRTC Support** - Ultra-low latency alternative

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Membrane Framework**: Excellent abstraction for multimedia processing
2. **Elixir/OTP**: Robust supervision tree and error handling
3. **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU encoding significantly reduces CPU load
4. **GitOps**: Flux automation streamlines deployment
5. **Incremental Testing**: Validating each phase on hardware caught issues early
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides created proactively

### Challenges Overcome

1. **rpicam-vid Compatibility**: Required `--codec h264 --libav-format h264` parameters
2. **Stream Format Alignment**: RTP payloader needed NALU alignment
3. **Multi-Client Architecture**: Switched from Tee.Master to Tee.Parallel
4. **iOS VLC Bug**: Identified client-side issue, verified with alternative apps
5. **SPS/PPS Extraction**: Required real camera parameters for iOS compatibility
6. **Mix.env/0 Runtime Error**: Fixed with compile-time configuration
7. **Camera Warnings**: Suppressed noisy libcamera logs with LIBCAMERA_LOG_LEVELS

### Best Practices Established

1. **Test on Hardware Early**: Don't rely on mocks for hardware-dependent features
2. **Document as You Go**: Write documentation during implementation, not after
3. **Practical Validation**: Prioritize real-world testing over exhaustive unit tests
4. **Configuration over Code**: Make everything configurable via environment variables
5. **Clean Logs**: Suppress unnecessary verbosity for production deployments
