## Notes & Blockers

### Current Blockers

- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Phase 1 hardware testing completed successfully
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Phase 2 RTSP server implementation complete
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Phase 2 RTP streaming format mismatch fixed (2025-10-22)
- **No blockers**: Video streaming fully working on hardware! Ready to proceed with Phase 3 (multi-client) or Phase 4 (containerization)

### Decisions Made

- **Module naming**: Using `Membrane.Rpicam.Source` (lowercase 'picam') as per the actual library
- **Dependency versions**: Updated to latest available versions:
  - membrane_rtp_plugin: 0.31.0 (from 0.29.0)
  - membrane_rtp_h264_plugin: 0.20.0 (from 0.19.0)
  - membrane_rtsp: 0.11.0 (from 0.7.0)
  - membrane_udp_plugin: 0.14.0 (from 0.13.0)
  - membrane_tcp_plugin: 0.6.0 (from 0.7.0)
  - membrane_h26x_plugin: 0.10.5 (unified H.264/H.265 parser)
  - membrane_fake_plugin: 0.11.0 (for Phase 1 testing)
- **Auto-start behavior**: Pipeline manager auto-starts on application boot
- **Configuration approach**: Using runtime.exs for production environment variables
- **Camera plugin**: Internalized `membrane_rpicam_plugin` for better control and compatibility
- **H.264 alignment**: Using NALU alignment (not AU) for RTP payloader compatibility
- **Camera binary**: Auto-detect rpicam-vid (newer) vs libcamera-vid (older)
- **RTP streaming**: Using UDP sink for now (simple single-client), will add Membrane.Tee for multi-client in Phase 3
- **RTSP session**: Each PLAY restarts pipeline with new client info (temporary solution for Phase 2)
- **Stream format**: Using `Membrane.RTP.StreamSendBin` which outputs `%RemoteStream{type: :packetized, content_format: RTP}` with properly serialized RTP packets

### Lessons Learned

- Membrane plugin versions change frequently; always check hex.pm for latest compatible versions
- The Membrane ecosystem uses lowercase module names (e.g., `Rpicam` not `RpiCam`)
- Starting with solid configuration management from the beginning saves time later
- **rpicam-vid stdout requires explicit format**: Need `--codec h264 --libav-format h264` for stdout output
- **Stream format alignment matters**: RTP payloader expects NALU alignment, not AU alignment
- **Membrane.Pipeline.start_link returns 3-tuple**: `{:ok, supervisor_pid, pipeline_pid}`, not 2-tuple
- **Internalizing small dependencies is beneficial**: Easier to fix and maintain than patching external deps
- **Hardware-specific fixes take time**: Allow buffer for camera/hardware integration issues
- **RTSP is straightforward**: RFC 2326 is well-documented and easy to implement
- **SDP generation is key**: Proper SDP with codec parameters is critical for client compatibility
- **Quick iteration wins**: Getting basic video working first, then adding multi-client support
- **UDP RTP is simple**: Just send packets to client IP:port, no complex protocol
- **Membrane stream format matching is critical**: Element input pads must match output pad formats exactly. `StreamSendBin` outputs `%RemoteStream{type: :packetized, content_format: RTP}`, not raw `Membrane.RTP`
