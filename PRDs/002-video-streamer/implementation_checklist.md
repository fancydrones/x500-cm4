## Future Enhancements (Backlog)

### Docker Image Size Optimization (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Analyze image size breakdown (current: 257MB)
- [ ] Investigate minimal runtime-only rpicam-apps build
- [ ] Consider Alpine stable base with backported rpicam-apps
- [ ] Explore removing unnecessary ffmpeg codecs/filters
- [ ] Remove dev dependencies from runtime (libcamera-dev, etc.)
- [ ] Implement multi-stage build cleanup (remove .a files, headers)
- [ ] Test distroless or minimal base images
- [ ] Document size reduction techniques
- [ ] Target: <150MB final image size
- **Rationale**: Current 257MB image is larger than desired for embedded deployment. Most size comes from ffmpeg dependencies pulled by rpicam-apps. Optimization could significantly reduce bandwidth and storage requirements.

### TCP/Interleaved RTSP Transport (High Priority)
- [ ] Design TCP/interleaved transport architecture
- [ ] Implement RTP over TCP with 4-byte interleaved framing

### Decisions Made

- **Module naming**: Using `Membrane.Rpicam.Source` (lowercase 'picam') as per the actual library
- **Dependency versions**: Updated to latest available versions:
  - membrane_rtp_plugin: 0.31.0 (from 0.29.0)
  - membrane_rtp_h264_plugin: 0.20.0 (from 0.19.0)
  - membrane_rtsp: 0.11.0 (from 0.7.0)
  - membrane_udp_plugin: 0.14.0 (from 0.13.0)
  - membrane_tcp_plugin: 0.6.0 (from 0.7.0)
  - membrane_h26x_plugin: 0.10.5 (unified H.264/H.265 parser)
  - membrane_fake_plugin: 0.11.0 (for Phase 1 testing)
- **Auto-start behavior**: Pipeline manager auto-starts on application boot
- **Configuration approach**: Using runtime.exs for production environment variables
- **Camera plugin**: Internalized `membrane_rpicam_plugin` for better control and compatibility
- **H.264 alignment**: Using NALU alignment (not AU) for RTP payloader compatibility
- **Camera binary**: Auto-detect rpicam-vid (newer) vs libcamera-vid (older)
- **RTP streaming**: ~~Using UDP sink for now (simple single-client), will add Membrane.Tee for multi-client in Phase 3~~ **Phase 3: Now using Membrane.Tee.Parallel for multi-client support**
- **RTSP session**: ~~Each PLAY restarts pipeline with new client info (temporary solution for Phase 2)~~ **Phase 3: PLAY adds client dynamically, TEARDOWN removes client**
- **Stream format**: Using `Membrane.RTP.StreamSendBin` which outputs `%RemoteStream{type: :packetized, content_format: RTP}` with properly serialized RTP packets
- **Multi-client architecture**: Camera → H264Parser → Tee.Parallel → (per client: StreamSendBin → UDPSink)
- **Client management**: PipelineManager.add_client/remove_client for dynamic client handling without pipeline restarts
- **Tee choice**: Using Tee.Parallel (not Tee.Master) as it supports dynamic outputs without requiring master pad

### Lessons Learned

- Membrane plugin versions change frequently; always check hex.pm for latest compatible versions
- The Membrane ecosystem uses lowercase module names (e.g., `Rpicam` not `RpiCam`)
- Starting with solid configuration management from the beginning saves time later
- **rpicam-vid stdout requires explicit format**: Need `--codec h264 --libav-format h264` for stdout output
- **Stream format alignment matters**: RTP payloader expects NALU alignment, not AU alignment
- **Membrane.Pipeline.start_link returns 3-tuple**: `{:ok, supervisor_pid, pipeline_pid}`, not 2-tuple
- **Internalizing small dependencies is beneficial**: Easier to fix and maintain than patching external deps
- **Hardware-specific fixes take time**: Allow buffer for camera/hardware integration issues
- **RTSP is straightforward**: RFC 2326 is well-documented and easy to implement
- **SDP generation is key**: Proper SDP with codec parameters is critical for client compatibility
- **Quick iteration wins**: Getting basic video working first, then adding multi-client support
- **UDP RTP is simple**: Just send packets to client IP:port, no complex protocol
- **Membrane stream format matching is critical**: Element input pads must match output pad formats exactly. `StreamSendBin` outputs `%RemoteStream{type: :packetized, content_format: RTP}`, not raw `Membrane.RTP`
- **Tee enables multi-client**: Membrane.Tee.Parallel allows splitting a single stream to multiple outputs dynamically
- **Tee.Master vs Tee.Parallel**: Master requires :master pad linked in spec; Parallel supports fully dynamic outputs
- **Dynamic pipeline modification**: Membrane pipelines support adding/removing children at runtime via handle_info
- **Unique SSRC per client**: Each client needs their own SSRC for proper RTP identification
- **SPS/PPS must match camera output**: iOS requires exact SPS/PPS from camera stream in SDP, generic values fail
- **Extract real parameters from stream**: Use ffmpeg to capture stream, parse NAL units, extract real SPS/PPS
- **iOS VLC has known RTSP bugs**: iOS VLC fails to decode valid streams that work on macOS and other iOS apps
- **Test with multiple iOS clients**: Always test with alternative apps (IP Camera Viewer, RTSP Player) to isolate issues
- **Constrained Baseline Profile works**: Profile 42C01F (Constrained Baseline, Level 3.1) works across all tested platforms
- **TCP vs UDP transport**: iOS apps often prefer TCP/interleaved but will fall back to UDP successfully
