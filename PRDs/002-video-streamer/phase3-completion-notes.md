# Phase 3 Completion Notes
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Phase:** RTP Integration & Multi-Client Support

## Overview
Phase 3 successfully implemented multi-client video streaming with dynamic client management. The system now supports multiple simultaneous RTSP/RTP clients without requiring pipeline restarts.

## Completed Features

### 1. Multi-Client Architecture
- **Implementation**: Membrane.Tee.Parallel for stream splitting
- **Dynamic Management**: Clients added/removed without pipeline restart
- **Unique Identification**: Each client gets unique SSRC for RTP session tracking
- **Clean Separation**: Each client has dedicated StreamSendBin and UDPSink

### 2. RTSP-RTP Integration
- **PLAY Command**: Dynamically adds client to pipeline via `add_client/3`
- **TEARDOWN Command**: Cleanly removes client via `remove_client/1`
- **Connection Handling**: TCP disconnect properly cleans up client resources
- **Session Management**: Session ID used as client_id for tracking

### 3. Platform Compatibility
- ✅ **macOS**: VLC tested with 2+ simultaneous clients - working perfectly
- ✅ **iOS**: IP Camera Viewer app - working correctly
- ⚠️ **iOS VLC**: Known decoder bug - shows "audio-only" (NOT a server issue)

### 4. H.264 Configuration
- **Profile**: Constrained Baseline (42C01F) for maximum compatibility
- **Level**: 3.1 (standard for 720p streaming)
- **SPS/PPS**: Real parameters extracted from camera stream
- **Parameter Sets**: Repeated before each keyframe via `repeat_parameter_sets: true`

## Technical Achievements

### Pipeline Architecture
```
Camera → H264 Parser → Tee.Parallel ─┬→ StreamSendBin → UDPSink (Client 1)
                                      ├→ StreamSendBin → UDPSink (Client 2)
                                      └→ StreamSendBin → UDPSink (Client N)
```

### SPS/PPS Discovery Process
1. Captured live H.264 stream with ffmpeg
2. Parsed NAL units to find SPS (type 7) and PPS (type 8)
3. Extracted 26-byte SPS and 4-byte PPS
4. Base64 encoded: `Z0LAH9oBQBbpqAgICgAAAwACAD0JAB4wZUA=,aM4PyA==`
5. Updated SDP with real camera parameters (not generic values)

### iOS Compatibility Investigation
**Problem**: iOS VLC showed "audio-only" despite no audio track in SDP

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- RTSP handshake: ✅ Completed successfully (4 attempts: TCP×3, UDP×1)
- RTP transmission: ✅ 600+ packets sent to iOS device
- Stream format: ✅ Constrained Baseline, correct SPS/PPS
- iOS VLC bug: ❌ Decoder fails despite valid stream

**Resolution**:
- Tested with IP Camera Viewer on iOS → ✅ Works perfectly
- Identified as iOS VLC specific issue (known bug in VLCKit)
- TCP/interleaved transport deferred to Phase 4 (may help iOS VLC)

## Key Commits
- `ad2fea5` - Add deterministic SSRC generation
- `6f70575` - Refactor UDP socket initialization
- `1cbf6c2` - Fix UDP socket port configuration
- `d7e6f4f` - Add repeat_parameter_sets for H.264 parser
- `4b1fd4f` - Update H.264 profile-level-id
- `97bf670` - Use real camera SPS/PPS in SDP
- `e114e44` - Add iOS VLC connection analysis

## Testing Results

### macOS Testing ✅
- **VLC**: 2 simultaneous clients streaming smoothly
- **Connect/Disconnect**: No crashes, clean resource cleanup
- **Stream Quality**: Clear 720p30 video with low latency

### iOS Testing ✅
- **IP Camera Viewer**: Full video playback working
- **RTSP Handshake**: Completes after TCP→UDP fallback
- **RTP Reception**: Verified 600+ packets received
- **iOS VLC**: Decoder issue (known bug), not blocking

### Not Tested (Deferred to Phase 5)
- [ ] 3+ simultaneous clients (stress testing)
- [ ] Performance metrics (CPU, memory, latency)
- [ ] Long-duration stability (>10 minutes)
- [ ] Rapid connect/disconnect cycles
- [ ] QGroundControl compatibility
- [ ] Network jitter/packet loss scenarios

## Known Limitations

### iOS VLC Incompatibility
**Issue**: Shows "audio-only" despite receiving valid RTP packets
**Cause**: VLCKit decoder bug on iOS 16+ (known community issue)
**Workaround**: Use alternative iOS apps (IP Camera Viewer, RTSP Player)
**Future Fix**: TCP/interleaved transport in Phase 4 may resolve

### UDP-Only Transport
**Current**: Only RTP/AVP/UDP supported
**Limitation**: iOS clients prefer TCP/interleaved
**Impact**: 3 failed connection attempts before UDP fallback
**Future Fix**: Phase 4 backlog item - add TCP/interleaved support

## Performance Notes
- **RTP Packet Rate**: ~200 packets/second for 720p30
- **Payload Size**: 1400 bytes max (standard MTU)
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: No restarts during client operations
- **Resource Usage**: Not measured (deferred to Phase 5)

## Lessons Learned

### H.264 Compatibility
1. **Generic SPS/PPS fails on iOS**: Must extract real parameters from camera
2. **Profile matters**: Constrained Baseline works universally
3. **Parameter repetition helps**: Repeat SPS/PPS before each keyframe
4. **SDP accuracy critical**: iOS pre-initializes decoder from SDP

### Multi-Client Design
1. **Tee.Parallel vs Tee.Master**: Parallel better for fully dynamic outputs
2. **SSRC uniqueness**: Generate deterministic but unique SSRC per client
3. **Resource cleanup**: Handle TEARDOWN and tcp_closed identically
4. **Session tracking**: Session ID doubles as client_id effectively

### Testing Strategy
1. **Test multiple clients**: Don't assume one client = all clients work
2. **Test multiple platforms**: macOS ≠ iOS even with same app
3. **Use alternative apps**: Isolate app bugs from server bugs
4. **Analyze logs thoroughly**: RTSP handshake logs reveal transport preferences
