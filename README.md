# :helicopter: RPiUAV

## :dart: Goal

[Pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/) and [Dronecode](https://www.dronecode.org/) are very powerful and mature platforms and eco-systems, but they lack the final wrapping to make a complete UAV system. This repository aims at providing this final wrapping, and making it as easy as possible to get started.

## :book: TL;DR

This repository aims at giving step by step instructs from zero to a fully operational UAV connected using a mobile phone and 4G/5G, by using available (ish) components and software. Some of the components selected are affected by the chip shortage (2022), and might be replaced as this hopefully improves shortly.
