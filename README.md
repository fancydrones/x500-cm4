# RPiUAV

This repository aims at giving step by step instructs from zero to a fully operational UAV connected using a mobile phone and 4G/5G, by using available (ish) components and software. Some of the components selected are affected by the chip shortage (2022), and can be replaced as this hopefully improves going forward.
