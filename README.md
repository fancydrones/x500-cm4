## :dart: Goal

[Pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/) and [Dronecode](https://www.dronecode.org/) are very powerful and mature platforms and eco-systems, but they lack the final wrapping to make a complete UAV system. This repository aims at providing this final wrapping, and making it as easy as possible to get started with a fully operational camera drone using LTE for communications.

Documentation can be found at [https://fancydrones.github.io/x500-cm4](https://fancydrones.github.io/x500-cm4)

## :rocket: Motivation

Main motivations for this repo:

- Bring all the pieces together to make a complete system.
- Make it as easy as possible to get started.
- Make it easy to keep the system up to date.

## :rotating_light: Disclaimer

Check the regulations in the country you are flying in, and make sure you are allowed to fly the UAV. LTE allows you to easily fly Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS), but you still need to follow the rules for BVLOS (which in most contries requires a special permit).

## :book: TL;DR

This repository aims at giving instructs from zero to a fully operational UAV connected using a mobile phone and 4G/5G, by using available (ish) components and software. Some of the components selected are affected by the chip shortage (2022), and might be replaced as this hopefully improves shortly. This repository should make it easy to get up and running with a complete camera drone, and to keep it up to date at all time.
